# WavEncryptor

A WavEncrypting and Decrypting software i I made fotr a software development module with an open brief.

Command line program which can take a WAV file and encrypt the audio rendering the contents undesipherable, a pincode is required to encrypt the file.

A file which has been encrypted by this program can be decrypted using the pin code set when file was encrypted.

Header only library Audiofile by written by Adam Stark, https://github.com/adamstark/AudioFile was used to handle reading and writing to WAV.

Currently only tested with with files exported from Audacity using WAV 16bit signed PCM format
